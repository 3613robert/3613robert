### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Robert and I'm new to coding in all aspects. I'm currently learning the basics of Python through 100 days of python by dr. Angela Yu. 

I've created this account to keep track of my projects and learning.

I'm currently working on a dnd character manager as a side projects to implement things I'm covering in the course. Any feedback would be great!
